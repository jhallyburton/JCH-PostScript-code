# JCH-PostScript-code
PostScript programs of moderate complexity

Programs in this repository typically have documentation (primarily, instructions for use) near the beginning of the file.
Also, the first line of the file should start with the characters %!PS often followed by -Adobe in case there are other PostScript implenentations.

"JCH" stands for John C. Hallyburton, the author of most, if not all, of the programs in this repository.
